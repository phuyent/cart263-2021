//Huyen Tran Pham

//A game based on a Netflix serie called Alice in Borderland.
//This is my stimulation on one of the game I find interesting in the serie.
//In the serie, the games are ranked after 52 cards, this one is 3 of clubs.
//Clubs are for games that needed both intelligence and health from the participant.
//There will be 10 rooms on a floor, an elevator will take you to the first room.
//In each room, the participant will have a limited time to
//choose between 2 doors to make it out of the building, thus crack the game and gain 3 days to live in Borderland.

//LET'S START//
